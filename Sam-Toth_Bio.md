## Co-op Work Experience
### Kinetic Vision
As a software engineer at Kinetic Vision, I worked on many different projects. The nature of the work at KV often varied depending on the projects the company was contracted to do. Therefore, I worked on anything from iOS development to DOS and Shell scripts. Kinetic Vision was my introduction both to the technical world and to iOS development. Working at Kinetic Vision was my first official job, and showed me that I really need to work for what I want, but I can perform at ##an industrial level. Finally, I think mobile development is a very exciting world and definitely an area of computer science I want to continue with.

### Siemens PLM Software
At Siemens PLM Software, I worked in their Advanced Solutions or CTO department. Advanced Solutions is essentially the company's research and development department. Through this, I was able to work on many projects on the cutting edge of technology, such as a Natural Language Processor that took human language and transformed it into database queries. One thing that I learned at Siemens was to be very open with my work and unafraid to ask questions. With the nature of my projects, I had to ask a lot of questions concerning the direction and future of the product. As a technical skill, I was introduced to the world of Java which came in handy for my research opportunity through the University of Cincinnati and Dr. Nan Niu.


## Project Sought:
I am looking for a machine learning related project or even software security.
I am very interested in both fields, although I have much more expertise in Software security.
