## Project Background
In the world of machine learning, there is a very strong hope to understand the meaning of programs. Not only does this problem expand to topics such as software security, but also to algorithms and even optimization. For example, a poorly programmed sort algorithm could be simply utilizing too many comparison statements. In the end, these extra comparisons can add to be a large amount of time wasted for running the program. However, if the overall functionality of this program is not understood, then these problems might not be able to be found. Hence, my project seeks to understand the meaning and functionality of simple programs, such as a search or a sorting program. In order to apply machine learning to learn a program, the project will employ the usage of denotational semantics. Denotational semantics is the translation of programming language constructs into mathematical objects. These objects will be a part of the state of the program and can describe the mathematical steps taken in order to reach the current state. By understanding these semantics, we hope to approach the idea of determining the functionality and purpose of a program.

## Problem Statement
With this project, I intend to explore fully the ideals of denotational semantics in programming. Initially, I hope to focus on the C or C++ programming languages and then branch using the same learning techniques to a more generalizable solution. Using these semantics, the program will help in determining the "functionality" of a set of programs using both a training set and a test set of basic program types, such as GCD, sorts, and searches. Furthermore, a goal of the project is to display this informational in a fashion that users can understand how the program operates.   

## Current Solutions
There are different attempts across the Internet for creating machine learning algorithms to learn the semantics of a programming language, but my project is on a much higher level of learning the semantics of a program in order to determine functionality of a simple program. From there, the project can branch into more refined generalizable solutions.

## Background skills
This project is in relation to my master's thesis. The research and materials used here will undoubtedly be useful in the machine learning aspects of my master's thesis. I am currently taking a class on machine learning and the professor overseeing the project has a lot of background in this area to help with any questions I may have.

## Approach
The final project is hoped to be a machine learning program that can take the import of several different sets of semantics which correspond to a simple program. Using this dataset, the test and training sets will be taken in order to run the algorithm. The problem in this is two-fold: How to classify the programs, as well as how to evaluate the individual semantics of the program. Using research and other information on this topic, a good classifier will be created. Finally, the project will include a way to understand these flow of these programs against one another. Being able to map visually these programs will undoubtedly lead to a stronger understanding of their mappings.
