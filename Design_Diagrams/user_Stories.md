For this assignment you will write 3-5 sentences, each with the following structure, which indicates the goal of your project from a user perspective: "As a person in role, I want goal or desire so that I have some tangible benefit.â€œ

## Story 1
As a computer scientist, I want to break the code into reasonable classes so that the word "functionality" is well described.

## Story 2
As someone who does not have much technical experience, I want visual examples so that I can understand how the machine learning classification works.

## Story 3
As a researcher, I want to detail my findings and search for patterns in the data so that my project could further be put to use for a published paper.

## Story 4
As a programmer, I want to write a machine learning algorithm that well classifies the data, so that the algorithm is applicable to different datasets.
