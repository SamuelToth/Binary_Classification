# Design Diagrams Conventions
Overall, the chart is created in a flow chart format. The algorithms for processing each part of the diagrams are not discussed, but however the overall goal of each part is detailed.


## Rhombus - Input / Output
Each occurrence of a rhombus is an input or output in within the program.

## Square - Function / Process
A square within the diagram indicates a performed function or process by the programs within the project. The only process done manually would possibly be the creation of the data files, however one goal of the project is to create a parser that would do this manually.

## Arrows - Data flow
An arrow details the flow of the program from each process and data type. A process will output some sort of data which will be input into the next process until the final output of classifiers.

## End Goal
As shown in the diagrams, the end goal is thus creating reasonable classifications of the date. With strong classifications, we can reuse the classification algorithm found within the machine learning step in order to classify more programs.
