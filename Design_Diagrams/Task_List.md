# Tasks To Do

### Task 1 - Research current implementations of project
Most likely this does not exist, but it is possible that someone has done something similar. Building from their projects could be very useful.

### Task 2 - Acquire simple C++ / C programs
These simple algorithms will be the basis of the assignment in terms of the training and test sets.

### Task 3 - Research Denotational Semantics
While I have a good understanding currently of the problem, getting more documentation and clearer understanding certainly will lead to stronger algorithms.

### Task 4 - Create assembly code for all of the simple programs
The assembly code of these files is the basis for the project.

### Task 5 - Port the assembly code into separate files of just steps
While the generation of assembly code is fairly straight forward, many other things are generated along with it and the removal of these extra pieces will be important towards better analysis.

### Task 6 - Write a parser to generalize the porting of assembly code
Writing a parser may take some time, due to my unfamiliarity with Regular expressions, but will later be needed for a faster generalization of the problem  

### Task 7 - Create a program to do the text analysis of each file
In order to create the data set, the program will need to analyze the operations of each program and count them accordingly.

### Task 8 - Define a list of variables (columns) to track for the assembly codes
This allows us to skip any codes that may not be useful or agglomerate statements (such as the different data types of add)

### Task 9 - Classify the different types of files
Initially this will be done by type of algorithm, but is a very important first step

### Task 10 - Research Machine Learning problems in order to determine the best algorithm
There are many different machine learning algorithms and choosing the best is never straight forward.

### Task 11 - Implement and analyze results from test set
The most important part in task 11 will be to search for patterns within the data. Using the results and performing some data analytics can help us find these patterns and utilize them going forward

### Task 12 - Reclassify files as needed and determine stronger classification analysis
The initial classifications of type of algorithm will need to be much more robust in order to classify the test set well.

### Task 13 - Redefine semantics as needed in order to better classify
As I have mentioned in the past, using just assembly language isn't an absolute coverage of the denotational semantics. Therefore further expansion will be needed

### Task 14 - Create a visual analysis of the programs
Clearly the problem and analysis will need to be detailed for those who are not familiar with the project to understand. This will be an integral part to the success of the project

### Task 15 - Reiterate through other tasks in order to best classify
Finally, the most important task is to re-do old tasks. Much like machine learning using multiple iterations to arrive at an optimal classifier, I will need to perform multiple re-definitions of the classifications as well as the variables.
