List of All Compiler Argument Choices:

-Wall - Warnings
-Wextra - Warnings

-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables
  Unwind Table is precise for calls only. Reduces bloat code generated
-fno-exceptions
  Disables exception handling  - AKA Not important for us
-fno-rtti
  Disable generation info for virtual functions in C++ - We aren't using the feature so good to rid of it
-flto


-Wl,--gc-sections
-Wl,--strip-debug


-march=i386
  architecture as simply i386 compiler - restricts further than m32
-msse
  Fixes how Floating point precision works
  Might not be very important but reduces dimensionality of floating point
  Requires march i386

-m32
  Compile as 32 bit binary - marchi386 overides?
  
-masm=intel
  Output Assembly in intel format (easier to categorize)

"$filename" -o Compiled/"$ActFile"
